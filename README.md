# ChatConnect 🌐💬

**ChatConnect** is a real-time, anonymous video and text chat application — inspired by platforms like Omegle — designed to connect strangers across the world.

🚧 **This project is currently under development. Some features may not work as expected. Thank you for your patience!** 🚧

### 💡 What Makes ChatConnect Different?

> 🌍 **Break the communication barrier!**  
ChatConnect lets you connect with people around the world **without language limitations** — thanks to real-time text translation (coming soon).  
Make friends, share ideas, build something meaningful together — or just talk and reduce your loneliness.
💬 If no real user is available, an AI bot will join your chat so you can keep the conversation going.
